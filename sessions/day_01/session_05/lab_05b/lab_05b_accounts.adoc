= Lab 05b - Build Accounts Service with Mysql/H2

Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes
[abstract]
--
In this lab we'll begin the second subproject of our complete cloud-native application architecture: _SpringTrader_, which implements the quotes fetching portion of a ``Trading-like'' application.
This microservice will provide the _Accounts Service_, which will allow us to create and browse user accounts.
We'll be using a relational model to represent the user accounts.
--

NOTE: The completed code for this lab can be found at `$COURSE_HOME/day_01/session_05/lab_05b/complete/springtrader-accounts`.

== Exploring springtrader-accounts

. Change to the lab directory:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_01/session_05/lab_05b/initial/springtrader-accounts
----
+
and import the project (via `pom.xml`) into your IDE of choice.

. Explore the new `accounts` microservice:
- How many domain classes do you now have? Are there relationships between those classes?
- How many controller classes?
+
As for `spring-trader-quotes`, You can see that static web files are not included in `springtrader-accounts`. They will all be contained in a `web` microservice (dedicated to the web layer)



. Add the following to `application.properties` -- we'll eventually want to run multiple apps locally, so we are using a port that is different from 8080:
+
----
server.port=8082
security.basic.enabled=false
spring.jpa.database-platform = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
----

. To run the application locally you have to add H2 dependency to your `pom.xml` file.
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
  	<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
 </dependency>
----

. Open `src/main/resources/import.sql`. As a naming convention, Spring Boot automatically loads this file at startup time. You will therefore have 2 accounts created by default at application startup time.

. Run the application and open the url http://localhost:8082/account/1 into your web browser. You should see the following:
+
[source,json]
----
{
   "id":1,
   "address":"45 Test Dr.",
   "passwd":"123",
   "userid":"johnsmith3",
   "email":"john@pivotal.io",
   "creditcard":"999999999",
   "fullname":"John Smith",
   "authtoken":null,
   "creationdate":null,
   "openbalance":1200.50,
   "logoutcount":0,
   "balance":null,
   "lastlogin":null,
   "logincount":0
}
----

== Preparing for Cloud Foundry

. Create the MySQL service.
+
----
$ cf cs p-mysql 100mb-dev springtrader-accounts-db
----
NOTE: if you are using Pivotal Web Service, the above service is not available in the command line. You just need to create it using the Web console at https://console.run.pivotal.io . You can select a MySql database service and name it `springtrader-accounts-db`.
+
. Rebuild the JAR:
+
----
$ mvn clean package
----

== Deploying to Cloud Foundry

. Create an application manifest in `manifest.yml`:
+
[source,yml]
----
---
timeout: 180
instances: 1
memory: 512M
env:
    SPRING_PROFILES_DEFAULT: cloud
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
applications:
- name: accounts
  random-route: true
  path: target/lab_05b-accounts-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
  services: [ springtrader-accounts-db ]
----

. Push to Cloud Foundry:
+
----
$ cf push

. Access the application at the random route provided by CF (such as `http://accounts-unexploited-boneset.cfapps.io/account/1`). The output should be the same as when run locally:
+
[source,json]
